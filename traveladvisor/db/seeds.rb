However the park was big , the rides were great .There is a big aquarium inside which we did not have time to visit")

Peak tram is fun but expensive and the waiting time is awfull. Finally on the peak there is a big shopping area. Which is nice to pass the time because when we arrived on top: there was no view at all! Cloudy!")

At the time, the wooden roller coaster was open but we opted not to ride it but it definitely seems to be the highlight in this amusement park. We visited on a Friday and crowd was tolerable. But there is quite a significant wait on the teenager rides.")

Because of that I didn't have a lot of expectations of Disneyland Hong Kong. We visited it last week. Weather was okey and it was so quiet! Unbelievable. We could do every attraction twice and even had some time left.")

If you love carousels, slides and different entertainment, you'll love it here. But be ready for long queues. I spent more time waiting in line than riding. The staff are friendly but English is a problem for the local population. And in case it's not cheap.")
